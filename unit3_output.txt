Lobbying Institutions: Chambers of Commerce and Industries, Trade Unions, 
Farmers Associations, etc.  
 
Lobbying Institutions  
 Lobbying is when an individual or group seeks to influence another individual or group to 
achieve a desired outcome. This is often done on behalf of a third party who has hired the 
lobbyist.  
 Lobbying institutions are organizations that seek to influence public policy and decision -making 
by advocating for specific legislation, regulations, or government actions.  
 They operate  at various levels of government —local, state, national, and even international —
and represent a wide range of interests, including businesses, industries, non -profits, unions, and 
other advocacy groups.  
 A lobbyist is someone who communicates with someone else or a group to influence them. It is 
typically done on behalf of another individual or group in exchange for payment.  
 An example o f lobbying is a special interest group that hires a lobbying organization to influence 
an elected official on a particular policy or law, such as with a pro -climate change group that 
hires a lobbyist to influence elected officials to create legislation add ressing rising temperatures 
in a specific geographic location.  
 In India, Lobbying is a practice that, while common in influencing public policy and legislation, 
is not as formally recognized or regulated as it is in countries like the United States. However, 
vario us institutions and organizations engage in activities that can be considered lobbying.  
Types of Lobbying Institutions in India:  
1. Industry Associations : 
o Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) : One of the largest industry associations in 
India, CII works to create and sustain an environment conducive to the growth of 
industry in India, often engaging with the government on policy matters.  
o Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) : Another major 
industry association that represents the interests of businesses in India, FICCI often 
lobbies for policy changes that benefit the industrial sector.  
o Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) : 
Represents various busin ess sectors and engages with the government on issues affecting 
trade and commerce.  
2. Professional Associations : 
o Indian Medical Association (IMA) : Represents doctors and medical professionals, 
often lobbying for healthcare policies, medical regulations, and other health -related 
issues.  
o Bar Council of India (BCI) : Represents the legal profession in India and can influence 
legal reforms and policies.  
3. Corporate Lobbying : 
o Large corporations in India, such as Reliance Industries, Tata Group, and others, engage 
in lobbying, either directly or through professional lobbying firms, to influence policies 
that affect their business operations.   
2  o Many multinational corporations operating in India also lobby for favorable trade 
policies, regulations, and market access.  
4. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Advocacy Groups : 
o NGOs like Greenpeace India and Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) lobby for 
environmental issues, public health, and social justice.  
o Advocacy groups work on specific causes, such as human rights, gender equality, and 
rural development, lobbying for legislative and policy changes.  
5. Lobbying Firms : 
o While not as prominent or as formalized as in some other countries, there are consulting 
firms in India that offer lobbying services. These firms often wor k on behalf of clients 
to influence policy decisions, regulatory frameworks, and government contracts.  
Work ing of Lobbying  
 Indirect Lobbying : Much of the lobbying in India is conducted indirectly, through 
consultations, meetings, and representatio ns to government committees and policymakers.  
 Public -Private Partnerships : Industry bodies often engage with the government through 
public -private partnerships (PPP) to influence policy decisions.  
 Consultative Committees : The Indian government often forms consultative committees that 
include industry representatives, experts, and stakeholders to help shape policies and legislation.  
 Media and Public Campaigns : Lobbying in India also involves shaping public opinion through 
media campaigns, think tanks, and pu blic discussions to indirectly influence policymakers.  
Regulatory Framework  
 India does not have a specific law regulating lobbying activities, which leads to a lack of 
transparency and accountability in how lobbying is conducted. However, there are discus sions 
and proposals about introducing regulations to bring more transparency to lobbying activities, 
such as the requirement for lobbyists to register and disclose their activities.  
Criticisms and Challenges  
 Lack of Transparency : The absence of a formal r egulatory framework makes it difficult to 
track and monitor lobbying activities, leading to concerns about corruption, undue influence, 
and lack of accountability.  
 Conflict of Interest : There are concerns that lobbying by powerful corporate interests may l ead 
to policies that favor a few at the expense of the broader public interest.  
 Public Perception : Lobbying is often viewed negatively in India due to its association with 
corruption and the perception that it undermines democratic processes.  
 Lobbying in India is a growing and evolving field, with increasing calls for regulation and 
transparency to ensure that it serves the public interest and does not undermine democratic 
governance.  
Chambers of Commerce and Industries

6  Structure of Chambers of Comme rce and Industry in India  
 The structure of Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India is designed to effectively 
represent the diverse interests of the business community and to ensure efficient operations. 
These organizations typically have a hierarchical  structure that allows them to function at 
multiple levels —local, regional, national, and even international.  
1. General Body (Membership)  
 Composition : The General Body comprises all the members of the chamb er, including 
individual businesses, corporations, industry associations, and other organizations. Membership 
can be categorized based on the size and nature of the business (e.g., small, medium, large

Vice Presidents. These positions are usually held by senior business leaders or experienced 
industry professionals.  
 Role : The President acts as the chief spokesperson of the chamber and represents it in high -level 
meetings with government officials, international delegations, and media. The P resident also 
presides over meetings of the Executive Committee/Council and ensures the implementation of

5. Standing Committees and Sub -Committees   
7   Composition : Standing Committees and Sub -Committees are formed based on specific sectors, 
issues, or functional areas (e.g., taxation, trade, infrastructure, education, etc.). These 
committees are typically chaired by experts or industry leaders in the respective fields.  
 Role : These committees focus on specialized areas, providing insights, recommendations, and 
action plans to the Executive Committee. They also  organize events, workshops, and discussions 
on sector -specific issues and contribute to policy advocacy by preparing position papers and 
reports.  
6. Regional and State Chapters  
 Composition : Large chambers of commerce, such as CII and FICCI, have regional and state 
chapters to represent businesses at the local level. These chapters have their own governing 
bodies, including Regional Councils, Presidents, and Secretaries.  
 Role : Regional and state chapters ensure that the chamber’s activities and advocacy are  aligned 
with local business needs and conditions. They work closely with state governments, local 
authorities, and regional businesses to address issues specific to their areas. These chapters also 
contribute to the chamber’s national policies and program s. 
7. Specialized Departments  
 Composition : Chambers often have specialized departments that handle various functions such 
as policy advocacy, international trade, research, member services, events management, and 
public relations.  
 Role : These departments a re responsible for the operational execution of the chamber’s 
initiatives. For example, the Policy Advocacy department would focus on analyzing government 
policies and preparing the chamber’s official response, while the International Trade department 
woul d work on promoting global trade opportunities for members.  
8. Advisory Boards and Panels

industrial realities of the country.   
8   This structured approach helps Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India operate efficiently, 
influence policy effectively, and provide valuable services to their members, contributing to the 
overall economic development of the country.  
Trade Unions  
 When a group of working population amalgamates to have a stable working condition with 
better facilities like proper wages, sanitation, healthcare, security, harmony, etc., or when the 
workers come together to speak for t heir basic rights and to maintain tranquillity in any 
workplace, the trade unions are formed. They are responsible for solving problems related to 
workers and do keep trying to solve them.  Presently,  more  than  16000  trade  unions  are 
established  in India  with 10+ million  workers.  
 Under  Article  19 (1) (c) of the Indian constitution, you have the right to form a trade union in 
India.  The first considered  Trade  Union  was formed  in April  1918  named  as Madras  
Labour  Union  led by B.P. Waldia.  
 
History of Labour Uni ons in India  
 
 In 1918,  the Textile  labour  association  (Majur  Mahajan  sangh)  was established in 
Ahmedabad and founded by Mahatma Gandhi along with Anasuya Sarabhai and Shankarlal 
Banker.  
 AIUTC  (All India  Trade  Union  Congress)  was established  on 31 October  1920 led by Bal 
Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai in which  Indian  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  formed  
in 1919  became a driving force for  AIUTC.  
 Trade  Unions  act 1926 , formerly Indian Trade Unions act gives the definition of the word 
‘Trade Union’ which means  to regulate  the relationship  between:  
 Workmen  and Employers  
 Workmen  and Workmen  
 Employers  and Employers  
 The relation can be temporary or permanent according to the terms and conditions set by both 
the parties which includes any association of two or more trade unions.  
 After  the Trade  Unions  Act 1926  and Trade  Disputes  Act 1929  the growth of trade unions 
propelled. Many more unions such as  Hind  Mazdoor  Sabha  (1948),  Bharatiya  Mazdoor  
Sangh  (1955)  were formed after the introduction of  Bombay  Industrial  Act (1946)  and 
Industrial  Employment  Act (1946)  as these acts resulted in strengthening the trade union 
moveme nts. Although almost 6 decades have passed since post independence, the Trade 
unions are facing several problems internally and externally.  Let’s  talk about  the problems  
faced  by trade  unions  in India.  
Internal Problems in Trade Unions:  
Leadership  
 When it  comes to leadership there is always a question in head, whether the leader should be 
an insider or an outsider. When workers from the inside lack in different skills (like Public 
speaking, language issues, under -confidence, lack of knowledge, illiteracy, economically 
weak etc.), the people from the outside are hired to lead the workers. Article 22 states that 50% 
of the incumbents can be from outside.  
 This creates a lot of chaos and disturbance in the working population because the outside 
leader is not am ong them which means that the leader is not able to understand the problems  
9  faced by workers. Leader will think more of his benefits instead of theirs. It leads to the 
lackadaisical growth of the union and will enfeeble the authority of unions. Generally, office -
bearers are elected for leadership and no decision making power is given to workers which 
leads to an undemocratic leadership.  
Uneven  Growth  of Unionism  
 The trade unions are mostly concentrated in organised sectors such as the textile industry. A 
few other industries where it is concentrated include coal mines, food industries, plantations, 
chemicals, utility services, commerce, transport and communications etc. The uneven growth 
can be seen in the example that in the plantation industry, unionism i s 28 percent whereas in 
tobacco manufacturing it is 75 percent.  
 Also, Due to the concentration of certain industries in big centres and certain states, unionism 
is mainly concentrated in those certain few states and industrial centres only. The members of 
trade unions are usually workers from manual labour class.   
Multipli city 
 There are a number of trade unions present in India which are the causes of disturbance 
between the labourers working in particular organisations. When we say multiplicity of trade 
unions, we mean that people compete with each other to get recognition by the authorities to 
form a union and forget about the main purpose of trade union which is to bring harmony 
among workers. This is somehow linked to political parties in a way that if there is a split in 
political parties, there will also be a split in trade unions. Workers follow the ideas of political 
parties but not the norms of trade unions. If some kind of chaos or ego clash happens in a 
union, it splits into two or many trade unio ns. This also affects the financial status of the union.  
Heterogeneity  
 The perception of each worker depends on his/her race, caste, religion etc. which can be easily 
exploited by outsiders to disturb the harmony of the organisation and sometimes becomes a 
very serious issue.   
Illiteracy  
 Workers in the unions are generally illiterate and don’t have knowledge about various topics, 
so the employers or outside leaders can easily manipulate them to earn profit.  
Finance  
 For any organisation to work, it should  be financed properly. The union should have adequate 
funds to pay its expenses like allowances, salaries, telegrams, rents and miscellaneous 
expenses. In the last few years, trade unions have faced financial crises mainly due to less no. 
of members in org anisations which leads to low membership subscription and hence becomes 
a cause for lower finances. The membership fee by the National commission on labour was 
suggested to be Rs.1 instead of 25 Paisa per month but the Government didn’t recommend it. 
Hence , low membership leads to low finance.  
Inter -union  rivalry  
 We have heard of Monopolistic markets, where a huge number of sellers compete with each 
other to get more profit. Likewise, if there are a large number of unions, they will definitely 
compete to e arn a fair amount of benefit. The employers, politicians and outside leaders may 
even cause problems to let down the other union. Everyone wants to add more members to get 
more revenue for which they need to look better than other unions.  
External Problems  in Trade Unions   
10  Tech nology:  Changes in technology are a serious issue for labourers because they don’t have skills 
or facilities to constantly learn about them. This leads to depletion in jobs and eventually reduces the 
number of members in the union.  
Government  support:  After the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1991, Unionism has affected a lot 
which means the Government is also lacking somewhere to support the labour union.  
Global  competition:  Globalisation of business means competition among workers which leads to a 
reduction of the working population in the country. By reducing the workforce and increment in 
wages, companies are earning more than usual.  
Policies:  The strategies made by the man agement focus on individuals, unit level bargaining and other 
things related to the benefits of organisation. This is responsible for weakening the unionism of labour 
and giving more importance to managerial policies instead of labour’s policies.

Challenges Faced by Trade Unions in India  
Decline in Membership:  
 
14   With the growth of the informal sector and changing employment patterns, trade union 
membership has declined. Many workers in the informal sector a re not unionized, which limits 
the reach and influence of trade unions.  
Fragmentation and Rivalries:  
 Trade unions in India are often fragmented, with multiple unions representing workers in the 
same industry or company. This can lead to rivalries, weakenin g the collective bargaining power 
of workers.  
Political Influence:  
 The close association of trade unions with political parties can sometimes lead to conflicts of 
interest, where the political goals of the party may take precedence over the workers' intere sts. 
Legal and Regulatory Challenges:  
 Despite numerous labor laws, enforcement is often weak, and legal challenges can delay the 
resolution of disputes. Additionally, the complexity of labor laws can be a barrier to effective 
unionization.  
Globalization an d Economic Reforms:  
 Economic liberalization and globalization have led to increased competition, which can put 
pressure on trade unions to accept compromises on wages and working conditions. The rise of 
contract labor and outsourcing has also weakened the bargaining power of traditional unions.  
Informal Sector and Unorganized Workers:  
 A significant portion of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector, where workers 
often lack basic rights and protections. Organizing these workers into trade unions is a 
significant c hallenge.  
Legal Framework Governing Trade Unions in India  
The Trade Unions Act, 1926:  
 Registration : The Trade Unions Act provides for the registration of trade unions and lays down 
the rights and liabilities of registered trade unions.  
 Legal Status : Reg istered trade unions  
Farmers Associations  
 Farmers unions are a group of farmers that work for the cause of farmers and try to solve various 
issues related to farming.  
Sign ificance of farmers union:  
1. Farmers Union, supports and encourages local and regional food systems.   
15  2. They represent family farmers and consumers on issues such as energy and food security, agriculture 
sustainability, rural development, and environmental conservation.  
3. They stand against monopolies in our food system, and it advocates for truth in labelling , competitive 
markets, a level playing field, and access to markets for our family farmers.  
4. Farmers union educates farmers on issues such as food safety.  
5. They supports and encourages the development of cooperative businesses.  
6. They work for fair food prices  for both farmers and consumers involving, educating and empowering 
rural youth for a better future.  
7. They help in building healthy, vibrant rural communities, ensuring an adequate supply of safe, 
nutritious food.  
8. They help to achieve the reduction of costs  and other measures designed to increase the economic 
benefits of farming.  
9. They strive to promote a higher standard of community life in agriculture.  
 
 Farmers' Associations in India play a crucial r ole in representing the interests of the agricultural 
community, advocating for policy changes, providing resources, and facilitating the overall 
development of the agricultural sector. Here’s a detailed overview of Farmers' Associations in 
India:  
1. Types  of Farmers' Associations  
Farmers' Associations in India can broadly be classified into several categories, including:  
 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs):  These are collectives of farmers who pool resources 
to improve productivity, marketing, and access to technology and finance. FPOs are registered 
under the Companies Act or Cooperative Societies Act.  
 Cooperative Societies:  These are organizations where farmers work collectively, especially in 
areas like dairy (e.g., Amul), sugar (e.g., cooperative sugar mills), and agriculture. They are 
governed by cooperative laws at the state level.  
 Farmers’ Unions:  These are more politica l in nature and advocate for farmers' rights, fair 
pricing, subsidies, and policy changes. Notable examples include the All India Kisan Sabha 
(AIKS), Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), and Shetkari Sanghatana.  
 Commodity Boards:  These boards, such as the Coffee B oard or Tea Board, represent the 
interests of farmers growing specific commodities. They help in regulation, promotion, and 
support of these crops.  
 Water User Associations (WUAs):  These are grassroots organizations formed by farmers to

reducing the role of middlemen, and ensuring better prices for their produce.

with banks and microfinance institutions or providing credit directly through cooperative banks.

demonstrations to educate farmers about modern farming techniques,  pest control, and the use 
of fertilizers and seeds.

buying in bulk and distributing to members.  
 Risk Management:  They may provide crop insurance or help farmers  understand and avail 
insurance schemes provided by the government or private companies.  
 Community Development:  Beyond agricultural activities, many associations are involved in 
broader community development activities, such as education, healthcare, and i nfrastructure 
development.
